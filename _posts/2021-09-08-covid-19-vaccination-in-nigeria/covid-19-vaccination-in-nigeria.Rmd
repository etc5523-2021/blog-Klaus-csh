## Introduction

With the large-scale production of vaccines, many countries in the world are speeding up the vaccination process. However, some countries are unable to develop and produce vaccines by themselves due to lack of scientific research and technical support and funds, especially in poor countries. As one of the representatives, Nigeria is a country under the [Humanitarian Response Plan(HRP)](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/operations/nigeria/humanitarian-response-plan), which requires external support. As a journalist, in this blog post I will focus on the introduction through [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) about Nigeria’s vaccination situation, to help them gain more support from countries.

## Data Description

Two data sets are used in a brief overview of the COVID-19 situation in Nigeria, one on COVID-19 cases and vaccination, and the other on the number of vaccines obtained in Nigeria.

### COVID-19 Confirmed cases, Death and Vaccination

Because Nigeria’s data is partially missing, it mainly shows the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and the number of vaccinations.

The following is the specific situation of the data.

```{r}
covid <- read.csv("data/owid-covid-data.csv") %>% 
  select(c("location","date","total_cases","new_cases","new_cases_smoothed","total_deaths","new_deaths","new_deaths_smoothed","total_cases_per_million","new_cases_per_million","new_cases_smoothed_per_million","total_deaths_per_million","new_deaths_per_million","new_deaths_smoothed_per_million","reproduction_rate","total_vaccinations","people_vaccinated","people_fully_vaccinated","new_vaccinations","new_vaccinations_smoothed","total_vaccinations_per_hundred","people_vaccinated_per_hundred","people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred","new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_million"))
source<- read.csv("data/COVID-19 Vaccine Doses in HRP Countries - Deliveries.csv") %>% filter(f == "Nigeria") %>% select(!c('f', 'ISO3'))
vaccination <-readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.csv")%>%
  filter(location == "Nigeria")

my_theme <- theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "grey98", color = "grey20"),
                  panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey98"),
                  panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey87"),
                  text = element_text(color = "grey20"),
                  plot.title = element_text(size = 22),
                  plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 17),
                  axis.title = element_text(size = 15),
                  axis.text = element_text(size = 15),
                  legend.box.background = element_rect(color = "grey20", fill = "grey98", size = 0.1),
                  legend.box.margin = margin(t = 3, r = 3, b = 3, l = 3),
                  legend.title = element_blank(),
                  legend.text = element_text(size = 15),
                  strip.text = element_text(size=17))
```

### Vaccine Source 

The following table contains the data descriptions for the vaccine source:

```{r description}
variables2 <- colnames(source)
description2 <- c("The vaccine pipeline through which the vaccine was delivered. Either COVAX or Other.", "The common name of the vaccine delivered", "The name of the funder that funded the procurement of the vaccine. 'Procured' is used where a country purchased the vaccines using their own funds.", "The number of doses delivered", "The URL of the source article where information about the delivery was published","Combination of pipeline and Funder", "The date when the vaccine delivery was reported")

kable(cbind(variables2, description2),
    col.names = c("Variables",
                  "Description"),
    caption = "**Data Description table for vaccine source**") %>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T) %>% 
  kable_paper("striped") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color ="#85CEDA", background = my_colors, align = "c") %>%
  column_spec(2, italic = T)
```


## Information on a global scale {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 

### Percentage of the vaccinated population

```{r echo=F}

# Organizaztion total_vaccinations_per_hundred by country
df_2_map <- covid %>%
              select(total_vaccinations_per_hundred, location) %>%
              group_by(location) %>% 
              slice(which.max(total_vaccinations_per_hundred))

highchart() %>%
  hc_add_series_map(
    worldgeojson, df_2_map, value = "total_vaccinations_per_hundred", joinBy = c('name','location'),
    name = "Percentage of the vaccinated population"
    )  %>% 
  hc_colorAxis(stops = color_stops(n = 10, colors = c("#440154", "#21908C", "#FDE725"))) %>% 
  hc_title(text = "Percentage of the vaccinated population by country") %>% 
  hc_subtitle(text = "") %>%
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_google()) %>%
  hc_tooltip(borderColor = "black",
             valueSuffix = "%",
             borderWidth = 0,
             style = list(fontSize = "14px", textOutline = "0.3px #404040")) 

```

### Percentage of the population fully vaccinated

```{r echo=F, fig.width=10}

# Organizaztion people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred by country
df_3_map <- covid %>%
              select(people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred, location) %>%
              group_by(location) %>% 
              slice(which.max(people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred))


 highchart() %>%
  hc_add_series_map(
    worldgeojson, df_3_map, value = "people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred", joinBy = c('name','location'),
    name = "Percentage of the population fully vaccinated"
    )  %>% 
  hc_colorAxis(stops = color_stops()) %>% 
  hc_title(text = "Percentage of the population fully vaccinated by country") %>% 
  hc_subtitle(text = "") %>%
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_google()) %>%
  hc_tooltip(borderColor = "black",
             valueSuffix = "%",
             borderWidth = 0,
             style = list(fontSize = "14px", textOutline = "0.3px #404040"))

```

As of September 3, 2021, the percentage of Nigerian vaccinated population is 2.37%, and the percentage of fully vaccinated population is 0.73%, which is much lower than the world average of [30.3%](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL). It can be seen from the map that the vaccination rate is very low throughout Africa.

### Source of vaccines

```{r vaccines, tab.cap='Sources of Vaccines received by Nigeria and their quantities'}
source %>% select(!c(Source.Url, NewPipeline, Date))%>%
  mutate(Doses = as.numeric(gsub(",", "", Doses)))%>%
  arrange(Vaccine)%>%
  kable()%>%kable_styling(fixed_thead = T,full_width = F, position = "center") %>% 
  kable_paper(c("striped", "hover")) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T,color ="#85CEDA", background = my_colors, align = "c")
```

As shown in the table above, almost all vaccines received in Nigeria come from other countries. The government purchased 300,000 doses of AstraZeneca, but for Nigeria, which has a large population, the number of vaccines does not meet the basic requirements.

## The impact of vaccines on the epidemic

### Situtation on new cases and new deadths

```{r cases, fig.width=8, fig.height=3,fig.cap="Specific changes in new cases and new deaths in Nigeria"}
covid %>%
  filter(location == "Nigeria") %>% 
  select(date, new_cases,new_deaths)%>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = new_cases:new_deaths,
                      names_to = "infection",
                      values_to = "count")%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = as.Date(date), y = count, color = infection )) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~infection,
             scales = "free_y") +
  theme_bw()+
  xlab("Date") +
  scale_color_manual(values = my_colors) +
    scale_linetype_manual(values=c("solid", "twodash")) +
    coord_cartesian(clip = 'off') +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    my_theme + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Reported Cases in Time", subtitle = "2021", y = "Frequency")
```

### Situtation on vaccines

```{r vaccinations, fig.width=8, fig.height=3,fig.cap="Changes in the number of vaccines"}
p2 <- vaccination %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = daily_vaccinations, color = "daily_vaccinations"))+ geom_line(na.rm= TRUE,size = 1.5)+
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Daily Vaccinations", title = "Daily vaccination from March to August") +
    scale_color_manual(values = my_colors) +
    scale_linetype_manual(values=c("solid", "twodash")) +
    coord_cartesian(clip = 'off') +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    scale_x_date(date_breaks = "months" , date_labels = "%b-%y") +
    my_theme + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),legend.position = "none") +
    labs(title = "Reported vaccinations in Time", subtitle = "2021", y = "Frequency")
ggplotly(p2)
```

According to the number of new cases and the number of deaths from Figures \@ref(fig:cases), it can be seen that the number has dropped significantly after the start of vaccination in March 2021 (Figure \@ref(fig:vaccinations)). The rise in July and August was also due to the shortage of vaccines, but after the vaccines continued to be supplied, their numbers fell again.

### Situtation on reproduce rate

```{r reproduce, fig.width=8, fig.height=3, fig.cap="The fluctuation of reproduce rate in Nigeria"}
 rate <- covid %>%
  filter(location == "Nigeria") %>% 
  select(date,reproduction_rate) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  mutate(reproduction_rate2 = c(reproduction_rate[2:length(reproduction_rate)],0),
         diff_rate = reproduction_rate - 1.25,
         date = as.Date(date),
         month=format(date,"%Y-%m")) %>%
  filter(date < "2021-09-04") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date,
             y = diff_rate))+
  geom_col(aes(fill = factor(sign(diff_rate))))+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold"))+
  labs(title = "Trend of reproduce rate ",
    fill = "Trend of rate")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors)+
  theme_bw()+
 theme(legend.position = "none")

ggplotly(rate)


```

The reproduce rate is compared with the initial data (Figure \@ref(fig:reproduce) . It can be seen that from the control of the epidemic to the beginning of the vaccination, these measures have led to a decline in the infection rate. However, due to the limited number of vaccines, and the mutation of the virus, the vaccine effect has been reduced, resulting in no significant drop in the infection rate.


## Conclusion

As a front reporter, I hope to report the real situation in Nigeria so that the world can focus more on this barren country, and hope that other powerful countries can help these countries more. The elimination of the epidemic does not depend on how quickly the powerful countries can control the epidemic, but on how quickly these weak countries can overcome the difficulties (@liang2020handbook). I hope that major countries can provide these countries with more economic, technological, and material support.
