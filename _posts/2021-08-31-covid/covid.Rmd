## My first experiences in Canada

I went to Canada a few years ago and spent the New Year there. I remember that I carried a piece of coal according to the custom and put the coal into the stove by myself as a gift to celebrate the new year. At the same time, I also said a blessing: "I wish the coal in your home will continue to burn forever." I will never forget that night. Canadians are hospitable, reserved and clear, sincere to others, and like modern art. They love ice and snow sports, and they regard Maple Leaf as a national treasure and the pride of the motherland. Canadians are known as "people who never get angry." The emergence of the new type of coronavirus has brought a nightmare to the whole world, and it has also shrouded a dark cloud over this simple country. At that time, the emergence of vaccines quickly brought dawn to this country. At that time, the epidemic in Canada was repeated. As a data analyst, I wanted to find out what caused this situation. Data is collected from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=CAN).

## Vaccine in Canada

Figure shows that the vaccine started in December 2020. In April 2021, Canada begin to increase the speed of the vaccine, and people begin to inject the second vaccine in July. Up to now, almost most people in the vaccinated population have received 2 shots of the vaccine.

```{r Fig1 ,fig.width=15, fig.height= 9}
vaccination_num <- vaccination %>%
    select(date, total_vaccinations, people_vaccinated,people_fully_vaccinated) %>%
    gather(key = group_var, value = "Cases", -date, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
    group_by(date, group_var) %>%
    summarise(n = sum(Cases, na.rm = F), .groups = "drop_last") %>%
    mutate(label = if_else(date == max(date), as.character(group_var), NA_character_)) 

vaccination_num %>% ggplot(aes(x=date, y = n, color=group_var)) + 
    geom_line(size = 1.5) +
    scale_color_manual(values = my_colors) +
    scale_linetype_manual(values=c("solid", "twodash", "dotted")) +
    coord_cartesian(clip = 'off') +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    scale_x_date(date_breaks = "months" , date_labels = "%b-%y") +
    my_theme + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
    labs(title = "Reported vaccinations in Time", subtitle = "2021", y = "Frequency")
```

Table 1 shows the specific situation of the vaccine injection, and adds a comparison of the number of people who have received two injections of vaccine and one injection. Through searching, it can be found that the number of people who have received two injections from 2021-07-03 has exceeded that of those who have received two injections. The number of people who have received one shot is nearly 10 times the number of people who have received one shot now, and the goal of covering all two shots has basically been achieved.

```{r Tab1, fig.width=17, fig.height=7}
vaccination_num %>% select(date : n) %>% 
  filter(date > as.Date("2021-01-04")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = group_var, 
              values_from = n) %>% 
  mutate(people_fully_vaccinated_percentage =(people_fully_vaccinated /
                                                c(people_vaccinated- people_fully_vaccinated))) %>% 
  mutate(people_fully_vaccinated_percentage = 
           percent(people_fully_vaccinated_percentage)) %>% 
    mutate_each(funs(prettyNum(., big.mark=",")))%>%  
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 4)) 

```

## Connection Confirmed cases and Vaccine in Canada

Figure shows the changes in the number of confirmed cases and the infection rate, and adds the three time points mentioned in Figure 1. It can be seen that with the start of vaccination, the number of infections has dropped significantly, but because of the emergence of vaccines, people have begun to less pay attention to their own anti-epidemic behavior has caused the number of infected people to usher in a wave of rise. When the second vaccination starts in April, the number of confirmed diagnoses also begins to decline, but after July, the number of people who wants to be vaccinated has basically been covered and the virus has mutated, leading to an increase in the number of infections.


```{r Fig2, fig.width=17, fig.height=7}
case %>% pivot_longer(cols = total_cases:reproduction_rate,
                      names_to = "infection",
                      values_to = "count") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = as.Date(date), y = count, color = infection )) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  facet_wrap(~infection,
             scales = "free_y") +
  theme_bw()+
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(as.Date("2020-12-15"),as.Date("2021-04-05"),as.Date("2021-07-15")),
                            color = "darkgreen", 
             linetype="dashed", size = 1) +
  xlab("Date") +
  scale_color_manual(values = my_colors) +
    scale_linetype_manual(values=c("solid", "twodash", "dotted")) +
    coord_cartesian(clip = 'off') +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    my_theme + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(title = "Reported Cases in Time", subtitle = "2021", y = "Frequency")
```

Table shows the changes in the number of vaccine injections and the number of infections, which further confirms that the number of infections fluctuates with the progress of the vaccine. The number of infections decreases in February and May, but the number of infections increases in April and August. 

```{r Tab2}
p1 <- data %>% select(date, new_cases_per_million, new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_million,reproduction_rate) %>%
  mutate(month=format(date,"%Y-%m")) %>%
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(new_cases_per_million = mean(new_cases_per_million, na.rm = T),
            new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_million = mean(new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_million, na.rm = T),
            reproduction_rate = mean(reproduction_rate, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  filter(month > '2020-11') %>% 
  rename("Date" = month)

p2 <- data %>% select(date, new_cases_per_million,reproduction_rate,new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_million) %>%
  mutate(year = format(date, "%Y")) %>%
  filter(year == "2020") %>% 
  group_by(year)%>% 
  summarise(new_cases_per_million = mean(new_cases_per_million, na.rm = T),
            reproduction_rate = mean(reproduction_rate, na.rm = T),
            new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_million = mean(new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_million, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  rename("Date" = year ) %>% 
  full_join(p1) %>% 
   gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = "Changes in reproductive rates and new cases and new vaccinations about COVID-19 in Canada",
             subtitle = "Profile of average million people of 2020-01-26 to now") %>% 
  tab_source_note(md("Source: Our World in Data")) %>% 
  cols_label(
    new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_million = html("New Vaccinations<br>(per million)"),
    new_cases_per_million = html("New Cases<br> (per million)"),
    reproduction_rate = html("Reproduction<br>  Rate")
  ) 

p2
```

In conclusion, if we want to further control the increase in the number of infected people, we need to increase people's awareness of prevention and control, frequent disinfection in public places, and the widespread popularization of vaccines and the development of vaccines for mutant viruses.

I wish that I can go to Canada again and have another New Year. I donâ€™t have to worry about the infection of the virus when I walk on the road generously. I believe that this day is coming soon.
